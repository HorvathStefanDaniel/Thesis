27/05/2025 20:24:56,1inamelon,No,Yes,3,1,3,3,5,The genre is vampire survivors and holocure is currently the peak of that genre. I don't feel incentivized to try this game out because it doesn't do anything better than or have anything new to add to the genre. (I only saw the first 2 minutes tbh idk for sure if there's anything new that other vampire survivors likes have already done),use cooler colors,seems mid tbh is that a fair assessment?

28/05/2025 15:22:23,,No,Yes,3,4,3,2,4,There is lot of objects so it's hard to comprehend everything that is happening and in streams usually they play a soundtrack,"It could either be streamed with a sound track or add a music theme for each map, because the sound gets repetitive disengaging after a few minutes","add some easter eggs in the game, that will surprise potential viewers"
